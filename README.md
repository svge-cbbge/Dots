# Dots

Note: all dots are symlinked to their appropriate locations.  

## Polybar

Polybar config is modified cuts theme from [polybar-themes](https://github.com/adi1090x/polybar-themes) (which needs to be installed to use the dots)  

Bspwm module uses [desknamer.sh](https://gitlab.com/jallbrit/desknamer)  

## Bspwm

Triple borders are created by using a modified version of [neeasade's 2bspwm script](https://github.com/neeasade/dotfiles/blob/master/wm/.wm/scripts/visual/2bspwm) and [Sweet's chwb3](https://github.com/wmutils/opt/pull/40) as I couldn't get [chwbn](https://github.com/neeasade/opt) working.  
They're not super reliable and don't work with some terminals (Termite and urxvt didn't work, while XTerm did).
